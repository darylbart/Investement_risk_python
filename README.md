# Investment Risk Appetite Determination Tool

The Investment Risk Appetite Determination Tool is a Python script that helps users assess their investment risk appetite by answering a series of questions. The tool calculates a risk profile based on the user's responses, providing insights into their investment preferences and risk tolerance.

## How it Works

1. Users are prompted to specify the number of questions they want to answer (between 5 and 20).
2. The script presents questions to the user, each with a predefined weight indicating its importance in determining the risk profile.
3. Users provide their responses on a scale of 1 to 5 for each question.
4. The tool calculates the weighted average of the user's responses, determining their risk appetite based on the average score.

## Questions and Weights

Questions are carefully crafted to assess the user's investment preferences and risk tolerance. Each question is associated with a weight representing its significance in the overall risk profile calculation.

For a complete list of questions and their respective weights, refer to the [questions.json](questions.json) file.
